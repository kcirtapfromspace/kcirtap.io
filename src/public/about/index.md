With a depth of experience within infrastructure engineering, Patrickâ€™s career has influenced work in logistics, tech, and travel industries. From an early age Patrick could be found taking apart all of his toys with a butter knife, going on long hikes to jump into abandoned quarries or running away from bears, and lastly, without success, avoiding getting sunburned the beach. Patrick now lives as far from a beach as he can, is still taking things apart, and continues to go on adventures.
