**Hi, I’m Patrick 👋**

A software engineer from Denver, Colorado. Its not too big, but also not as busy.

Blogging about my experiences, to help others but mostly keep track of what I’ve done.

Lifelong learner and open-source enthusiast, mainly working on building data analytic platforms that help organizations deliver insights.

From an early age I could be found taking apart all of my toys with a butter knife.
Growing up in the Poconos I would be found going on adventures, wondering the woods,  jumping into abandoned quarries, tubing down the river, and occasionally running away from bears.
My family would vacation at beaches up and down the East coast where I would promptly dig a hole and read under my umbrella and get a wicked sun burned.
Now a days I primarily spend my time, noting without much success, avoiding sunburns.

I now live as far from a beach as he can, is still taking things apart, and continues to go on adventures.

If you enjoyed some of the stuff I wrote, you can [buy me a coffee ☕️](https://ko-fi.com/kcirtapfromspace), I’d really appreciate it! Thanks!🙏
